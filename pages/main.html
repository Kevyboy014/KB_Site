        Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Kevin Brink, as you may
        have guessed from the URL, and this is my website. While this website
        will surely change styles and purposes from time to time, for now
        my primary goal for having a website is to have a sort of online resume,
        as well as having an easy way to experiment with new ideas that I
        have for web development. It is currently done in pure
        HTML/CSS/Javascript, with no Content Management Systems (i.e.,
        Wordpress). Feel free to look around, but keep in mind that this
        site is still very much a work in progress. 
    </p>
