    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a 22-year old Christian, and right now I'm studying Computer Engineering
        Technology at Algonquin College in Ottawa. I am currently on a co-op
        work term at <a href='http://www.pythian.com/'>Pythian</a>, doing
        primarily web development. I enjoy playing almost any kind of <a href='/interests/sports.php'>sport</a>,
         and also play several <a href='/interests/music.php'>musical instruments</a>, including drums and guitar;
        but you can read more about that stuff in my <a href='/interests.php'>interests</a>
        page.

        As an added bonus, here's some random facts about me:
        <ul>
            <li>
                I like the color pink; any choice I have in color for
                almost anything, it's pink.
            </li>
            <li>
                My favorite number is 14. One reason for this is that, as an
                early hockey fan, one of my favorite players was <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoren_Fleury'>Theron Fluery</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
