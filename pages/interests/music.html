    <h1>Here's a list of some instruments I've played</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Drums: Pounding animal skins is something I've done for a good
            piece of my life. We first got a drum set when I was around 12
            years old, so I've had a little bit of experience. For the most
            part, I play drums for my church, <a href='http://www.hcfcornwall.ca/'>
            Harvest Christian Fellowship</a>, and for our youth church,
            <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ignite-Cornwall/221597501245627'>Ignite</a>.
